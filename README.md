# ALIVEVent
ALIVE Vent is a COVID-19-inspired, ultra-cost-effective, rapid assembly, in vivo validated, clinically focused, multi-feature ventilator for use in resource-scarce regions. This work is published in Bio-Desgin and Manufacturing.

<h2>Project Abstract</h2><br>
Resource-scarce regions with large outbreaks of COVID-19 do not have enough ventilators to support critically ill patients, and these shortages are especially devastating in developing countries. To help alleviate this strain, we have designed and tested the Accessible Low-barrier In-vivo Validated Economical Ventilator (ALIVE Vent), a COVID-19-inspired, cost-effective, in vivo validated solution made from commercially available parts. The ALIVE Vent operates using compressed oxygen and air to drive inspiration, while two solenoid valves ensure one-way flow and precise cycle timing. The device was functionally tested and profiled using a variable resistance and compliance artificial lung and validated in anesthetized large animals. Our functional testing revealed effective operation under a wide variety of ventilation conditions defined by the American Association of Respiratory Care guidelines for ventilator stockpiling. Large animal testing showed that our ventilator performed similar to if not better than a standard ventilator in maintaining optimal ventilation status. FiO2, respiratory rate, inspiratory to expiratory time ratio, positive-end expiratory pressure, and peak inspiratory pressure were successfully maintained within normal, clinically validated ranges, and the animals were recovered without any complications. In regions with limited access to ventilators, the ALIVE Vent can help alleviate shortages, and we have ensured that all material is publicly available. While this pandemic has elucidated enormous inequalities in health care, innovative, cost-effective solutions aimed at reducing socio-economic barriers, such as the ALIVE Vent, can help enable access to health and life on a global scale and beyond COVID-19.<br>

As this project is a humanitarian-focused endeavor, this public repository is meant to explain the design of the ALIVE Vent and give anyone the basic tools to reproduce a similar system.

The ALIVE Vent is comprised of three subsystems: (1) the Pressure Regulating Subsystem (PRS), the Inspiratory/Expiratory Subsystem (IES), and (3) the Control and Monitoring Subsystem (CMS) (figure 1), and the majority of parts were sourced from McMaster-Carr Supply Company (Elmhurst, IL), an American industrial supplier. Functionally, the PRS receives the input of compressed gas and translates it to the proper pressure and oxygen titration level required for the patient. This system is comprised of four main components: (1) the gas line connectors, (2) the pressure regulators, (3) the flow regulators, and (4) the oxygen sensor. Since our testing was done in an equipped medical setting with access to high pressure air and oxygen (approximately 50 psi), our gas connectors used Ohmeda valves and stainless-steel union fittings which connected to the pressure regulators with in-line mechanical pressure gauges. The two relieving, mechanical pressure regulators were specifically identified to precisely convert a wide range of compressed gas pressures to low pressures (0-2 psi). These pressure regulators were connected to flow regulators via push to connect interfaces and firm polyurethane tubing for an additional level of control to independently titrate the FiO2, which is not required for full titration functionality. Finally, these two lines were joined and connected to a zirconia oxygen sensor. While medical-grade, disposable, electro-galvanic oxygen sensors specifically made for ventilators can and should be used, we did not want to contribute to the shortage of supply in our experimental application. Ultimately, the final output of the PRS is a stable, regulated, low pressure, oxygen-titrated gas supply specifically tuned to the patientâ€™s needs.

Receiving the PRS input of modulated gas supply, the IES functions to deliver precise doses of inhaled gas to the patient in a unidirectional configuration equipped with flow monitoring capabilities. The IES is comprised of two electrically controlled solenoid valves, an inspiratory flow sensor, a pressure sensor and gauge, and hose barbs for interfacing with split medical ventilation tubing delivered to the patient. The use of two solenoids and split tubing ensures unidirectional flow through the system, allowing for adequate expulsion of carbon dioxide from the patient. The electronic pressure sensor was connected to the inspiratory solenoid to continuously monitor lung pressure, as it is important to make sure that the pressure does not exceed clinically validated values. Additionally, the electronic pressure sensor is critical for monitoring and control of PEEP. The inspiratory flow sensor (Honeywell, Charlotte, NC), is used to identify flow within a range of 0-100 SLPM and calculate the tidal volume, and an identical, optional expiratory flow sensor can be included for monitoring capabilities. Finally, in our case, the expiratory solenoid valve was connected to a hose barb and medical tubing, which outputted to a negative pressure wall exhaust port in our operating room. If this is not feasible in an emergency setting, HEPA filters should be used at the exhaust port to prevent the exhaust of an airborne virus.

The CMS actively controls and monitors the components in the other subsystems and is comprised of a computer running our Python software application, a circuit board, and a power supply. The inputs to the CMS include the oxygen sensor from the PRS and the flow and pressure sensors from the IES, while the outputs of the CMS are the actuation of the two solenoid valves in the IES. The inputs and outputs are consolidated on our circuit board, and each of them are processed via the on-board microcontroller. The circuit board contains two N-channel MOSFETs connected to the microcontroller and 24V power supply which are used to actuate the solenoids. The sensor information is measured via either the I2C communication protocol or an analog to digital converter. A 12V linear voltage regulator powers the 12V pressure transducer from the 24V source. The microcontrollers then communicate with our software platform via the Python serial library, and the data is displayed on our graphical user interface written using the PyQt5 list of the software components are intended to display metrics, the software also applies feedback control based on these metrics. For example, PEEP and maximum PIP are controlled via sensor-mediated threshold gating of the solenoid valves based on the lung pressure readings, resulting in pressure control, which is how we chose to operate our ventilator. Additionally, VT-gating using the flow sensors as input allows for volume control, which can be switched by the software platform. While this control system has been designed in a prototyping capacity, more work should be done to create additional alarming and safety protocols in both the software and electronics for better patient safety and easier physician use.
